# machine-learning-housing-price-prediction

This project is a house price prediction model using linear algebra techniques, employing linear regression to find the relationship between various features (e.g., size, number of rooms) and the house price.

**Data Preparation:** Preprocesses the data set and normalizes features.
**Model Formulation:** Sets up a linear system to model the relationship between features and house price.
**Matrix Operations:** Uses linear algebra methods to solve for the model coefficients.
**Prediction:** Applies the model to predict house prices based on input features.
